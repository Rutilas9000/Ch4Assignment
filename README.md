This contains java exercises that deal with exception handling.
Excercise1 wants the user to insert two integers and it will return their sum.
Exercise2 generates an array of 50 random double values and allows the user to access values by specifying an index.
Exercise3 checks if the sides provided for a triangle are valid and tests the functionality with different sets of sides. It also creates a custom exception used to find invalid sides of a triangle.
